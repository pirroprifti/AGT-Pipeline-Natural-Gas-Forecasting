<h1>AGT Pipeline Natural Gas Forecasting</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on predicting the AGT pipeline's natural gas demand for the year 2022 using weather data from Boston, the regional hub of the pipeline. A combination of machine learning and statistical models is employed to capture the non-linear relationship between weather variables and gas demand. The repository includes a Python notebook which implements regression and decision tree models for analysis in addition to an Quarto R script adapted from the Python notebook to align with the requirements of a graduate course in Linear Models and Regression, focusing solely on regression methods. Lastly, a comprehensive analysis and commentary rendered from an Rnw file is provided in regards to the R script code. This repository demonstrates the application of data science techniques to a real-world energy demand problem while meeting academic requirements.

- <b>R</b>

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="left">
1.) Make sure all packages are installed and loaded. <br/>

<br />
2.) Download the demand data excel sheet (agt.xlsx) and input the file path specific to your machine in the read_excel functions in the Python and R documents. <br/>

<br />
3.) Run all. All the results should load and appear once the previous steps are fulfilled. <br/>

<br />
Note: The Rnw file is provided for reference, rendering it will produce the pdf available in the repository. <br/>
