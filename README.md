<h1>AGT Pipeline Natural Gas Forecasting</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on predicting the AGT pipeline's natural gas demand for the year 2022 using weather data from Boston, the regional hub of the pipeline. A combination of machine learning and statistical models is employed to capture the non-linear relationship between weather variables and gas demand. The repository includes a Python script which implements regression and decision tree models for analysis in addition to an R script adapted from the Python script to align with the requirements of a graduate course in Linear Models and Regression, focusing solely on regression methods. Lastly, a comprehensive analysis and commentary rendered from an Rnw file is provided in regards to the R script code. This repository demonstrates the application of data science techniques to a real-world energy demand problem while meeting academic requirements.
